# LHL-Final-Project
# Analyzing player performance and their market value of a football club
# Key objectives:
Data preprocessing and feature engineering.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).
Model selection and evaluation.
Hyperparameter tuning for optimization.

# Data Sources:
Datasets were scrapped from fbref.com and transfermarkt.com
Description:
Key features (Goals, Assists, Market Value ...).
Target variable (Market Value).
Preprocessing Steps:
Cleaning missing values.
Handling outliers.
Feature scaling and encoding.

# Methods
EDA:
Description of key visualizations and insights (e.g., distribution of market value, correlation heatmaps).
Feature Engineering:
Interaction terms (e.g., Goals * Assists).
Polynomial features.
Feature selection techniques like RFE.
Model Selection:
List of models tested (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost).
Metrics used for evaluation (e.g., MAE, MSE, RÂ²).
Hyperparameter Tuning:
Description of the tuning process.
Key parameters tuned and their impact on performance.

# Challenges and Future Work
Challenges:
Handling data imbalance or missing values.
Overfitting during model training.
Future Work:
Collect more data for better generalization.
Explore additional models (e.g., RandomForest).
